# Hexa-link-robotic-arm
This project features a multi-DOF robotic arm controlled using servo motors and a PCA9685 PWM driver. The system enables smooth, precise joint movement and supports manual control as well as record-and-play automation. Designed for learning robotics, embedded systems, and pick-and-place applications
